# Based Faucet Suite

Welcome to the Based Faucet Suite! This project is a comprehensive solution for builders to access faucets securely and efficiently. The suite includes various components designed to address the needs of the development community.

## Project Components

### 1. Farcaster Faucet Bot
The Faucet Bot allows users to cast and get faucets on multiple networks including Arbitrum, Base, and Mode. This ensures that developers have the Testnet ETH when they need without hassle. It is more of public way and it fetches the verified address associated with the FID to drip faucet.

- **Usage:** Cast `@faucetbot Base` on Farcaster.

### 2. Based Frame
The Based Faucet Frame provides a secure interface for users to obtain up to 0.02 ETH on Base Sepolia, provided they have a @talent Builder Score of above 20. This additional security measure prevents bot attacks and ensures genuine users get the resources. They can claim 0.01 ETH/day and other checks for hoarding as well, all governed by smart contracts.

- **Usage:** Visit the Hash and solve a simple Addition Captcha.
